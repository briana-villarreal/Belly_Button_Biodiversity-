# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
This project consisted of generating a dashboard that displayed information regarding the bacteria that live inside a human's belly button. The data is obtained from a sample of hundreds of individuals. The dashboard visualizes each individual's demographic information, their top 10 bacteria cultures found, the frequency of belly button washing, and the bacteria cultures per sample.
